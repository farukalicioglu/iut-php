						<h4 class="align-left"><strong>TIPS & SUGGESTIONS</strong></h4>

						<p>
						From training routines to diet, helpful tips for preperation and race time.
<br /><br />
	-	Hot weather and the long course should be taken in to consideration for the course comprises sharp descents and ascents, rough and varying terrains. Running all through the course might be hard. A fast walk may be required at some places. 
							<br /><br />
							Running/walking ratio varies according to the performance of the competitor. Therefore:<br />
*To succeed in an ultra marathon, the most important factor after endurance and fitness is a balanced diet. The balance and strategy of your diet during the race is as important as your physical stamina.<br />
*It is best to exercise for the long stages. It is advised to change between running and walking during these exercises.<br />
*Running/walking with a backpack imposes burden on different muscle groups. Therefore, it is best to do some parts of the exercises with a backpack, preferably with the same backpack to be used in the race and with the same weight. You may also want to exercise with the shoes you will use during the race.<br /><br />
	-	It is important to get accustomed to long exercises especially for the ultra marathon category. Your body should be fit for supporting at least an 8 hours walk with minimum breaks before the race.<br />
	-	It can be useful to exercise in hot weather if possible.<br />
	-	Exercise on a rough terrain. This way the muscles and tendons around ankles and knees will get stronger and injuries will be avoided.<br />
	-	Exercise upslope and down. This way you will strengthen different muscle groups.<br />
	-	It is important to strengthen waist and back muscles especially for carrying the backpack.<br />
<br />
<strong>Advise for equipment:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Shoes </strong><br />
Running and trekking shoes are advised. It is better to wear 1-2 size bigger shoes in case of swelling and bandage. The soles of the shoes shouldn't be too much soft for the running will take place at some sharp and rough rocky terrain. New shoes are not advised precisely. It is advised to exercise with the same shoes you will wear at the race. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Batons</strong><br />
Batons are helpful at steep ascents and descents. They take the heavy load from feet and add support from the arms. They are strongly suggested in such course. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Hats and Bandanas</strong><br />
Because of the high intensity of sun light during the marathon, hats or bandanas are absolutely necessary. Brimmed hats are advised for protecting the back of the neck. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Sun glasses</strong><br />
Sunglasses are a must. It would be very difficult to complete this marathon without them. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Sun screens</strong><br />
High protective factor sun screens are an absolute necessity due to high level of UV rays. 
<br /><br />
<strong>Food</strong><br />
	-	Food / nutritional supplements that are preferably intended to be consumed during running will be supplied by the runners and can be carried in backpacks. <br />
	-	‘FeedZones’ will be arranged on the race course by the event. <br />
	-	It is important to pay attention to salt intake. It is recommended to consume plenty of salt and / or take salt tablets during the race. <br />
<br />
<strong>Water Containers and Hydration Systems</strong><br />
Enough water will be provided at the check points. It would be more effective to consume water at intervals. For this reason, water tanks can be preferred for hands free movement.
